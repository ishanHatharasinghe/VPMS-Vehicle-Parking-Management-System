#System Requirements  
The Vehicle Parking Management System's requirements are essential for creating a 
comprehensive solution that addresses the challenges of inefficient parking management at 
the company headquarters. These requirements can be categorized into two main types: 
functional and non-functional. 
Functional Requirements define the specific features and functionalities that the system 
must support to ensure effective operations. One of the primary functional requirements is 
real-time monitoring of parking space availability. This feature enables users to access up
to-date information about available parking spots, reducing the time spent searching for 
spaces and minimizing congestion at entry points. Additionally, the system must 
incorporate an automated parking spot allocation mechanism. This allows for efficient 
assignment of parking spaces based on predefined criteria, such as vehicle type or user role 
(e.g., employee or visitor), thereby optimizing the use of available resources. 
Another critical functional requirement is the management of vehicle registration and 
access control. The system should allow for the registration of vehicles and provide access 
control to ensure that only authorized vehicles can enter the premises. This enhances 
security and prevents unauthorized access to restricted areas. Furthermore, the system 
should support robust reporting and analytics capabilities, allowing management to 
generate insights into parking trends, usage patterns, and overall system performance. This 
data will aid in decision-making and further optimization of parking operations. 
Non-functional Requirements, on the other hand, pertain to the performance and usability 
aspects of the system. A crucial non-functional requirement is the need for a user-friendly 
interface. The system must be intuitive and easy to navigate, ensuring that both employees 
and visitors can quickly access the necessary information without technical difficulties. 
This is vital for enhancing user satisfaction and ensuring efficient interactions with the 
system. 
The system's integration with an SQL database is another significant requirement. This 
integration will provide reliable data storage and management capabilities, ensuring that 
parking information is stored securely and can be retrieved quickly. Scalability is also a 
non-functional requirement; the system should be designed to accommodate future growth, 
allowing for the addition of new features or an increase in the number of users and vehicles 
without compromising performance. 
#Functional Requirements  
• Real-time Parking Availability: The system continuously monitors and displays the 
availability of parking spaces in real-time. This feature ensures that both staff and 
visitors are aware of the current status of the parking lot before entering the premises. 
It minimizes congestion at the main gate by providing up-to-date information, allowing 
users to decide whether to enter or seek alternative parking options, thus saving time 
and reducing frustration. 
• Parking Spot Registration and Allocation: The system allows users to register and 
allocate parking spots based on specific criteria, such as vehicle type (car, motorcycle, 
etc.) or user status (employee or visitor). This automated allocation ensures efficient 
use of space by assigning suitable spots to users based on their needs. It also eliminates 
manual processes, improving the overall efficiency and organization of parking 
operations. 
• Vehicle Registration: For efficient access control and parking monitoring, the system 
includes a vehicle registration feature. Users must register their vehicles in the system, 
which enables tracking of vehicle entry and exit. It also helps manage access, ensuring 
that only registered vehicles are allowed into specific areas, thereby increasing security 
and optimizing space usage. 
• Profile Registration: Profile registration allows the system to personalize user 
experiences and manage user-specific settings. This feature enables individual users, 
whether employees or visitors, to create profiles with details such as vehicle type, 
preferred parking spots, and access permissions. Personalization improves user 
convenience and the system's ability to manage parking allocations effectively. 
• Entries Management: The system records and manages vehicle entries, capturing 
details like the vehicle’s entry time and identification. This data helps in monitoring the 
use of parking spaces and ensures that the system updates parking availability in real
time. By efficiently managing vehicle entries, the system reduces delays and ensures 
smooth traffic flow within the parking area. 
• Exit Management: Like entries, the system handles vehicle exits by updating the 
availability of parking spaces in real-time as vehicles leave. Exit management is crucial 
for maintaining accurate parking availability and ensuring that the system reflects the 
current state of the parking lot. It also helps in generating accurate reports on parking 
usage. 
• System Reset: To maintain operational continuity, an administrative feature for 
resetting the system is essential. In the event of technical issues or operational errors, 
the reset function allows administrators to address problems quickly without 
interrupting the system's functionality. This ensures minimal downtime and enhances 
the system's reliability. 

• Reporting and Analytics: The system provides robust analytical tools that generate 
reports on parking usage, trends, and occupancy rates. These reports assist management 
in making informed decisions regarding parking space utilization, operational 
improvements, and future planning. Analytics also offer insights into peak usage times, 
enabling better allocation strategies and resource optimization. 
#Non-Functional Requirements 
• Scalability: This feature ensures that the system can accommodate an increasing
